This repository includes code contained in several folders:

1) The Ex_1 folder contains a program, the initialization of which occurs when the user enters two numbers (A and B), after which, using a loop, the first number A is raised to the power of B.
2) The Ex_2 folder contains a program, which is initialized by the user entering a number, after which the program issues the sum of the digits in this number.
3) Ex_3.0 and Ex.3 folders contain a program, which is initialized after the user enters the array size, its minimum and maximum values. After that, using the Next.Random() method, the array is filled with random numbers. This program code is used by me as a template for solving many problems.
